        content:'The success of mid laner Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok and T1 (formerly SK Telecom T1) is inextricably tied to the first decade-plus of League of Legends esports. Since Faker debuted in 2013, the third season of competitive League of Legends, he has been at 13 of the 18 premier international tournaments that Riot Games has held. Faker & Co. have won five of them: three League of Legends World Championships and two Mid-Season Invitationals.,Worlds 2023 will be Fakers 14th appearance at one of Riots international tournaments. It also will be his first time competing in a world championship in his home country of South Korea. Faker and T1 will enter the tournament as runners-up at Worlds 2022 and looking to capture the organizations first world championship since 2016. After so much success in Faker’s first five years as a pro, the last seven have been marked by a more competitive international landscape, with Chinese teams rising up to challenge Korean teams as the best in the world. No team has won back-to-back or even multiple world championships since Faker and SKT did so in 2016. No team has won MSI and Worlds in the same year either except Faker and T1 in 2016.'
